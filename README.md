# gapeffecttimer
This is a Timer to get advantage of the gap effect described by Andrew Huberman in point 5 of his Neuroplasticity Super Protocol

As described in Huberman Neuroplasticity Super Protocol (https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/teach-and-learn-better-with-a-neuroplasticity-super-protocol), "...if we pause every so often for 10seconds and do nothing during the pause, neurons in the hippocampus and cortex—areas of the brain involved in learning and memory, engage the same patterns of neural activity that occurred during the actual activity of reading, musical practice, skill training, etc. but 10X faster—meaning you get 10X neural repetitions completed during the pause."

This timer sets a countdown with a random time between 01min40s and 2min20s, followed by another 10s countdown, and repeats that sequence until it's canceled.
